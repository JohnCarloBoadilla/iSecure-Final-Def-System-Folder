Here is the complete, updated flow for vehicle recognition:

1.  **Request to `app/main.py`**:
    *   A request is made to the `/camera/recognize_and_compare_plate` endpoint in `app/main.py`. This endpoint is responsible for initiating the vehicle recognition process.

2.  **Camera Frame Capture (`app/main.py` using `app/config.py`)**:
    *   `app/main.py` calls `camera_vehicle.read_frame()` (defined in `app/config.py`) to capture a single frame from the configured vehicle camera.

3.  **Image Storage (`ID' Data for ocr/` - NEW ADDITION)**:
    *   Immediately after capturing the frame, `app/main.py` now saves this raw image as a timestamped JPG file (e.g., `20251107-153000_capture.jpg`) into the `ID' Data for ocr/` directory. This provides a persistent visual record of the captured vehicle.

4.  **License Plate Recognition (`app/services/vehicle_recog/license_plate_ocr_scanner.py`)**:
    *   The captured frame is converted into a byte stream.
    *   `app/main.py` then calls the `detect_vehicle_plate()` function from `app/services/vehicle_recog/license_plate_ocr_scanner.py`, passing these image bytes.
    *   Inside `detect_vehicle_plate()`, the `mindee` client (initialized with `MINDEE_API_KEY` from `app/config.py`) sends the image bytes to the Mindee API.
    *   The Mindee API processes the image and returns the detected license plate information.
    *   `detect_vehicle_plate()` extracts the license plate number from the Mindee API's response and returns it to `app/main.py`.

5.  **JSON Data Storage (`License Plate Data/` - NEW ADDITION)**:
    *   Back in `app/main.py`, after receiving the `recognized_plate` from the OCR service, it now creates a JSON file (e.g., `20251107-153000_capture.json`) in the `License Plate Data/` folder. This JSON file contains the `id_type` (philippine_license_plate), the `license_plate_number` (or "Not found"), and a placeholder for `vehicle_type`.

6.  **Comparison and Response (`app/main.py`)**:
    *   `app/main.py` compares the `recognized_plate` with any `expected_plate_number` provided in the original request.
    *   Finally, it constructs and returns a JSON response to the client, indicating whether a match was found and the `recognized_plate` number.

In essence, the flow now includes saving both the raw image and a structured JSON data file for each vehicle recognition event, providing a comprehensive record of the process.
